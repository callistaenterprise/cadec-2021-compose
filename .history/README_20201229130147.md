> Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It's based on the declarative programming model, so you can simply describe what your UI should look like, and Compose takes care of the rest—as app state changes, your UI automatically updates. Because it’s built on Kotlin, it's fully interoperable with the Java programming language and has direct access to all of the Android and Jetpack APIs. It’s compatible with the existing UI toolkit, so you can mix and match classic and new views, and it’s designed with Material and animations from the start.
