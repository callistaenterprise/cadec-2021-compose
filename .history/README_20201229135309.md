## What is Jetpack Compose 
---
- A modern Toolkit for building native Android UI
- Declarative programming model
    - You declare the layout/ look and feel
    - As State Changes your UI automatically updates
- Built on Kotlin
- Designed with Material UI
- Animations from the start
- Tightly integrated into Android Studio

> Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It's based on the declarative programming model, so you can simply describe what your UI should look like, and Compose takes care of the rest—as app state changes, your UI automatically updates. Because it’s built on Kotlin, it's fully interoperable with the Java programming language and has direct access to all of the Android and Jetpack APIs. It’s compatible with the existing UI toolkit, so you can mix and match classic and new views, and it’s designed with Material and animations from the start.

## When 
---
- Jetpack launched at Googles 2018 I/0 Developer conference
- Jetpack Compose launched at Googles 2019 I/0 Developer conference
- Alphas appeared in 2020 now on 1.0.0-alpha09

## Driving force 
---
### Leland Richardson
- Lead React Native Architect at Air BnB
- Creator of Enzyme
- Hugely popular in the react community, conferences, speaker
- Switched to Google at the same shortly afer Air BnB ditched React native
- Gave a "what if" presentation on the possibility of using Kotlin or Swift with Reacts Paradigm
- Main driving force behind Jetpack Compose and the main link back to the React community

## Thinking in Jetpack Compose -

- ### Declarative
>1. Declarative API that allows you to render your app UI without *Imperatively* mutating UI views
    1. Imperative way of updating UI is to directly mutate the UI widgets internal state, using methods like addChild or setText, much like in JQuery
    2. Becomes messy and hard to track changes over time.
>2. Simplifies building and updating user interfaces
>3. Recomposes the entire screen from scratch, applying state changes to the UI
    1. Can be expensive although the algorithm for Recomposition is fast.

- ### Composable Functions 
>1. Fed data and emits UI elements
>2. annotated with @Composable
>3. Wraps your data in other composable like Text.
>4. Doesn’t return anything, emits UI hierarchy by calling other composable functions.
>5. Idempotent, Pure, free of side effects, behaves the same way when called a number of times.

- ### Data Down, Events Up
  - Data
>1. Imperative object orientated UI toolkits, have a tree of internal stateful widgets with getters and setters, which your app logic interacts with.
> 2. With compose, Composables are relatively stateless and are not exposed as objects, but *functions*.
> 3. You call these with different arguments and they respond with those arguments transformed into UI.
> 4. You update the UI by calling the same composable function with different arguments.
> 5. Data trickles down from the top level composable.

  - Events
> 1. When the user interacts with the UI through an event ( onClick ).  
> 2. The app logic will mutate the state 
> 3. This new state is then trickled down by calling the composable with fresh arguments. 
> 4. This is known as recomposition.
